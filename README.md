# Notez
This is a simple app for creating notes.
Main screen is a list over all notes created.
Each note can easily be deleted, by clicking
the delete button on each row.
Adding or editing a note has its own dedicated
screen, where you give it a title and content.

# Additional features
Currently, this is only a first functional version
of the app and I have things I want to change/add.
- Modernize the layout.
- Add a preview feature. This should allow for people to view their notes in the list or some other way in the main screen without having to enter edit mode.
